# AP Statistics

This repository contains a variety of resources, assignments, and other such items from my AP Stastics class with Ms. Lund in Spring 2019 at South Pointe HS.

The file Upcoming.html contains an easy to view list of all assignments, quizzes, and tests.  Pardon the French in the structure, but the assignment names are English.  The timestamp in the top left of the file shows the last time it was updated and "À échéance" simply means "due by."  The dates are in format YY-MM-DD.

The Book Pages folder contains precisely that - scanned PDF pages of the homework problems from the book, updated as assigned.

The Homework folder contains homework answers, as completed by me.  The basic "numeral" answers will be posted as soon as possible (where applicable), so that other's work may be checked.  However, the full solutions and answer phrases will be redacted until one day after the assignment was due.

The Notes folder contains my notes from class, taken with OmniOutliner.  OmniOutliner can be used to view outlines for free on macOS and iOS, however, costs 10$ to be able to edit files and 60$ to edit using additional features.  I will export my notes to PDF as I complete/update them, however, I may forget.  Ensure that the commit message/tag matches the PDF to ensure that the PDF version is up to date.  There is also a timestamp in the top right of each page which shows the time and date which the notes were last exported.  When applicable, images may be added to supplement notes.  The full filename will be referred to in the notes and found in the folder alongside them.

Finally, the Resources folder contains select resources given in class.

If you have questions, let me know by text or in class!  I'm happy to help where I can, however, repeated/long-term help may require tutoring fees be assessed.

I may lead study groups from time to time, or one-on-one sessions if you need individual help.  I'll post/share about study groups, and if you need an individual session don't hesitate to contact me!
